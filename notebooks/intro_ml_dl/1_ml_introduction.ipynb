Machine learning includes many techniques, but here we will focus on only those necessary to transition into deep learning. For example, random forests, support vector machines, and nearest neighbor are widely-used machine learning techniques that are effective but not covered here.\n",

    "**Supervised learning** means predicting $y$ from $\\vec{x}$ with a model trained on data. It is *supervised* because we tell the algorithm what the labels are in our dataset. Another method we'll explore is **unsupervised learning** where we do not tell the algorithm the labels. We'll see this supervised/unsupervised distinction can be more subtle later on, but this is a great definition for now. \n",

    "To see an example, we will use a dataset called AqSolDB{cite}`Sorkun2019` that is about 10,000 unique compounds with measured solubility in water (label). The dataset also includes molecular properties (features) that we can use for machine learning. The solubility measurement is solubility of the compound in water in units of log molarity."
